I couldn't turn my head or lift my right shoulder. My neck was tilted to the left, tendons and muscles stiff and in pain. My body was exhausted but couldn't lie down; when I did manage to grit my teeth and lie down on my back, I couldn't get up. Resting still was painful, but moving even more so. _Swearing increases your pain tolerance_, I remembered. I cursed out loud in my room, not exercising any restraint — one of the good things about living alone; thanks, Covid — sometimes with screams triggered by sudden bursts of pain. I wouldn't know which part of the movement I did wrong; I might be only standing up or walking, and in a split second, I would freeze with that horrid, searing pain buried deep in my muscles and burning through my neck and shoulders all the way to my arms. 

It was five o'clock in the morning. I had had the worst neck sprain for days, but I didn't have time for the UHS. I was not so much waiting until a free morning when I would be finally free to go and have it checked as hoping it could just heal itself. It would, eventually. But at the time, it seemed the pain would go on forever. I got up, folded my blanket into a square and tucked my bedsheet under the mattress, crying, but then even the most mundane activity became so intolerable that I had to stop _to_ cry, the tears nearly uncontrollable — but it wasn't just about the pain. It almost _wasn't_ about the pain:

No one was there to put a hand behind my shoulders to offer some strength that I could borrow when I lay in the dark at 4:30, listening to the alarm ringing across the room, too in pain to get out of bed. In the end, I sat up hissing, alone. 

No warm hands. No warm voice, concerned and perhaps good-naturedly nagging about me not taking care of myself. No gleaming eyes looking into mine. I felt angry.

By the sink, in front of that mirror lit by dim, greenish light, struggling to get the toothbrush to work in the right directions, I was suddenly afraid of my own ageing, of the prospect of fading away disconnected, isolated, alone. I laughed, remembering that I always prided myself on being able to enjoy solitude. I still did; it was just the pain.

During the day, it got better, and I didn't cry again. I met a friend when taking the lift downstairs to take my temperature, and she gave me a hug, not aware of my physical pain. Her embrace was powerful and warm, and her eyes were knowing. As I'm writing, there is finally some hope for recovery, and I only have to wait. But I don't want to forget about the pain. __I don't want to grow accustomed to the _non-pain_ and to the hubris of the _healthy_.__ I want to remember it forever; even though the remembering offers no comfort, the alternative will be even bleaker. 

And that's how I conclude my day, as I'm sitting at my desk, jacket on, spine crooked, writing and in pain. Everything is forever changing. It's going to get dark.
