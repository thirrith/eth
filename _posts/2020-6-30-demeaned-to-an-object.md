> When you debate a person about something that affects them more than it affects you, remember that it will take a much greater emotional toll on them than on you. For you it may feel like an academic exercise. For them, it feels like revealing their pain only to have you dismiss their experience and sometimes their humanity. The fact that you might remain more calm under these circumstances is a consequence of your privilege, not increased objectivity on your part. Stay humble.

记住，当你与他人就影响对方甚于影响你自己的议题进行争辩时，他们的心灵因此所受的挫折亦远甚于你。对你来说这只是一场学术讨论、思维训练；于他们而言，这却像是揭开伤疤，任你掷弃他们的经历、甚至贬抑他们的人格。在此情况下，你若能较他们冷静，并非由于你更理智客观，而是因为你本拥有特权。要保持谦逊。
